# TM470 Cordova app
This is the basis for my TM470 project with the Open University. 

It is a mobile app that has the potential to replace the current paper based form currently in use for managing the fleet of vehicles and PDAs at Royal Mail. 

Staff will be able to sign a vehicle or a PDA out, and the app will save this information to a database. This information is required by
law for a period of 12 months. The database will be able to show  management and authorised staff information on who has signed for a van and PDA, the time they left and returned to the office along with the confirmation they have completed all expected duties and followed the health and safety standards in place.
