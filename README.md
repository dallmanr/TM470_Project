# TM470 Cordova app
This is the basis for my TM470 project with the Open University. 

It is an app that will allow the office to replace the current paper based form for signing vehicles and PDAs in and out. 

Staff will be able to sign a vehicle or a PDA out, and the app then save this information to a database. This information is required by
law. The database will be able to show,  management and authorised staff information on who has taken what and when, the time they left and returned to the office along with the confirmation they have followed the health and safety standards in place.
