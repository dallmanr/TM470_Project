# TM470 Cordova app
This is the basis for my TM470 project with the Open University. 

It is an app that will allow the office to replace the current paper based form for signing vehicles and PDAs in and out. 

Staff will be able to sign a vehicle or a PDA out, and the app then save this information to a database. This information is required by
law. The database will be able to show, allow management and authorised staff to view information on who has taken what and when. 

Alongside the signing of vehicles and PDAs out, it will store information on the health and safety standards expected of staff.
Staff will be required to acknowledge this before signing anything out.
